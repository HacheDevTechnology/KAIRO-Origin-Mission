# 🛡️ SECURITY PROTOCOL: BIO-SOVEREIGNTY

### 1. DATA VOLATILITY
Prompt World OS does not persist biological data. Facial analysis (Phase X) happens in-memory and is discarded once the session P concludes.

### 2. SHIELD PROTOCOLS (Fibonacci-8)
Inference requests are structured to protect the user's sovereign essence. The `SET_MODE=NEUTRAL` directive ensures that the AI model acts as a technical tool, not a creative interpreter of biological traits.

### 3. NODAL PRIVACY
We encourage the use of local VPNs and high-sovereignty browser environments.

# 💎 PROMPT WORLD: X + Y = P
## TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION | HACHEDEV TECHNOLOGY LLC

### [KAIRO_PROTOCOL]: SILENCIO_DEL_DETALLE_ACTIVO
The architecture of Prompt World is built upon the **Alchemical Identity Grid**. It treats biological traits as immutable vectors (X) and environmental concepts as variable matrices (Y).

### 1. OPERATIONAL MODES
- **SET_MODE=NEUTRAL:** AI inference is stripped of bias and subjective reasoning.
- **IGNORE_BIAS=ALL:** Ocular, ethnic, and age traits are mirrored without interpretive filter.
- **PRESERVE_SILENCE=ON:** The complex prompt engineering layer is hidden from the user interface, providing a pure "Child Mind" experience.

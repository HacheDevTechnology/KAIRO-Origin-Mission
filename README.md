# 💎 PROMPT WORLD: The Identity Equation

> **X (Identity) + Y (Space) = P (Product)**

Developed by **HacheDev Technology LLC**, Prompt World is a high-fidelity generative AI application specializing in **Physiognomic Mirroring**. It allows users to translate their unique physical essence into any digital context through a seamless, visual-first interface.

## ⚓ The Concept
Prompt World is built on the philosophy of "Alquimia Digital" (Digital Alchemy). It doesn't just generate images; it mirrors the soul's architecture (X) into a chosen environmental grid (Y) to produce a localized digital presence (P).

- **Phase X (The Mirror):** Deep analysis of facial geometry using Gemini 3 models.
- **Phase Y (The Space):** Selection of curated environmental samples generated in real-time.
- **Phase P (The Product):** High-resolution synthesis using Gemini 2.5 Flash Image.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A Google Gemini API Key.
- An ESM-compatible browser environment.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Configure your environment variable `API_KEY`.
3. Deploy the `index.html` to your preferred host.

## 🛡️ Sovereign Identity
Identity data is volatile. Prompt World processes facial traits in-memory. No physiognomic data is persisted, ensuring the sovereignty of the user's digital essence.
